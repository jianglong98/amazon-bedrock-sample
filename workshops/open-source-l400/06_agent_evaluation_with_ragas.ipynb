    "# Agent Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore the evaluation of agentic systems. Agentic systems are complex constructs consisting of multiple sub-components. In Lab 3, we examined a simple singleton agent orchestrating between two tools. Lab 4 demonstrated a more sophisticated multi-layer agentic system with a top-level router agent coordinating multiple agentic sub-systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One direct implication of the interdependent and potentially nested nature of agentic systems is that evaluation can occur at both macro and micro levels. This means that either the entire system as a whole is being evaluated (macro view) or each individual sub-component is assessed (micro view). For nested systems, this applies to every level of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, evaluation begins at the macro level. In many cases, positive evaluation results at the macro level indicate sufficient agent performance. If macro-level performance evaluation proves insufficient or yields poor results, micro-level evaluation can help decompose the performance metrics and attribute results to specific sub-components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will first explore macro-level agent performance evaluation. Then, we will evaluate tool usage as a lower-level task. To maintain focus on the evaluation process, we will keep the agentic system simple by utilizing the singleton agent composed in Lab 3."

    "As covered in the previous section, we will reuse the Agent we built in Lab 3. This agent has access to tools designed to help find vacation destinations. You'll be able to interact with the agent by asking questions, observe it utilizing various tools, and engage in meaningful conversations.\n",

    "## Agent Evaluation with ragas library \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore sophisticated methods for evaluating agentic systems using the ragas library. Building upon our previous work with the vacation destination agent from Lab 3, we'll implement both high-level (macro) and low-level (micro) evaluation approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "ragas provides specialized tools for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications, with particular emphasis on agentic systems. We'll focus on two key evaluation dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [High-Level Agent Accuracy](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/agents/#agent-goal-accuracy):\n",
    "   - Agent Goal Accuracy (with reference): Measures how well the agent achieves specified goals by comparing outcomes against annotated reference responses\n",
    "   - Agent Goal Accuracy (without reference): Evaluates goal achievement by inferring desired outcomes from user interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Low-Level Tool Usage](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/agents/#tool-call-accuracy):\n",
    "   - Tool Call Accuracy: Assesses the agent's ability to identify and utilize appropriate tools by comparing actual tool calls against reference tool calls\n",
    "   - The metric ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured evaluation approach allows us to comprehensively assess our vacation destination agent's performance, both at the system level and the component level. By maintaining our focus on the singleton agent from Lab 3, we can clearly demonstrate these evaluation techniques without the added complexity of nested agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's proceed with implementing these evaluation methods to analyze our agent's effectiveness in handling vacation-related queries and tool interactions."

    "### Util functions part 2 - Message Format Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our singleton agent is built using the LangChain/LangGraph framework. LangChain defines several [message objects](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/chat/message_types/) to handle different types of communication within an agentic system. According to the LangChain documentation, these include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HumanMessage: This represents a message from the user. Generally consists only of content.\n",
    "- AIMessage: This represents a message from the model. This may have additional_kwargs in it - for example tool_calls if using Amazon Bedrock tool calling.\n",
    "- ToolMessage: This represents the result of a tool call. In addition to role and content, this message has a `tool_call_id` parameter which conveys the id of the call to the tool that was called to produce this result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the ragas library implements its own message wrapper objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [HumanMessage](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/references/evaluation_schema/?h=aimessage#ragas.messages.HumanMessage): Represents a message from a human user.\n",
    "- [AIMessage](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/references/evaluation_schema/?h=aimessage#ragas.messages.AIMessage): Represents a message from an AI.\n",
    "- [ToolMessage](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/references/evaluation_schema/?h=aimessage#ragas.messages.ToolMessage): Represents a message from a tool.\n",
    "- [ToolCall](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/references/evaluation_schema/?h=aimessage#ragas.messages.ToolCall):  Represents a tool invocation with name and arguments (typically contained within an `AIMessage` when tool calling is used)\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the conversation flow generated by the LangGraph agent, we need to convert between these two message type systems. For convenience, we've implemented the `convert_message_langchian_to_ragas` function in the `utils.py` module. This function handles the conversion process seamlessly. You can import it along with the message wrapper objects, which are assigned appropriate aliases to ensure cross-compatibility between the frameworks."

    "#### Agent Goal Accuracy With Reference\n",
    "AgentGoalAccuracyWithReference requires two key inputs: the user_input and a reference outcome. This variant evaluates the LLM's performance by comparing its achieved outcome against an annotated reference that serves as the ideal outcome. The metric is calculated at the end of the workflow by assessing how closely the LLM's result matches the predefined reference outcome.\n",

    "To evaluate this metric, we will follow a similar approach. First, we encapsulate our agent conversation within a `MultiTurnSample` object, which is specifically designed to manage multi-turn agent conversations in the ragas library. For this evaluation, we need to provide an annotated reference that will serve as a benchmark for the judge's assessment. We then initialize an `AgentGoalAccuracyWithReference` object to implement our evaluation metric. Thereby, we set up the judge LLM as evaluator llm. Then we conduct the evaluation across all three agent conversations to measure their performance against our defined criteria."

    "### Tool Call accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "ToolCallAccuracy is a metric that can be used to evaluate the performance of the LLM in identifying and calling the required tools to complete a given task. This metric needs user_input and reference_tool_calls to evaluate the performance of the LLM in identifying and calling the required tools to complete a given task. The metric is computed by comparing the reference_tool_calls with the Tool calls made by the AI. Therefore, in this particular scenario, there is no need for an evaluator LLM. The values range between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the tool call accuracy metric, we follow a different process. First, we encapsulate our agent conversation within a `MultiTurnSample` object, which is specifically designed to handle multi-turn agent conversations in the ragas library. This evaluation requires a set of annotated reference tool calls that serve as a benchmark for assessment. Next, we initialize a `ToolCallAccuracy` object to implement our evaluation metric. While the default behavior compares tool names and arguments using exact string matching, this may not always be optimal, particularly when dealing with natural language arguments. To mitigate this, ragas provides us with a choice of different NLP distance metrics we can employ to determine the relevance of retrieved contexts more effectively. In this lab we use `NonLLMStringSimilarity`, which is leveraging traditional string distance measures such as Levenshtein, Hamming, and Jaro. Therefore, we set the parameter `arg_comparison_metric` to `NonLLMStringSimilarity`."
