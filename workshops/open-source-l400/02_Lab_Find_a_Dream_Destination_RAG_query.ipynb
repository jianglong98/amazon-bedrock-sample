    "# Complete Document Retrieval and RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "- **Retrieval Pipeline** With customers having the ability to enter any number of possibilities into the solution, it is helpful to detect intent and normalize the query. Few-shots are a useful tool to tailor the normalization to the nature of the query in-line. \n",
    "- **Advanced methods** For more complex cases, it can be beneficial to generate hypothetical queries and documents solving for sub-queries and improving the semantic similarity.\n",
    "- **Model answer generation** Once the model is shown a set of documents, it must generate an answer while staying as closely aligned to the contents of the documents as possible. We cover self-verification and citation as methods giving greater flexibility to the model for a given query and set of retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) requires the indexation of relevant unstructured documents into a vector database. Then given a customer query, the relevant are retrieved and past as context to the model, which generates an answer. This can best be described by the following flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/rag-architecture.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our documents (PDFs, CSV, Tables, JSON, ...) have been indexed into our knowledge base, we start working towards retrieval of a relevant subset of documents based on a given query. For many applications, the success of the retrieval is a strong indicator for the performance of the overall response. This notebook assumes you are familiar with the basics of RAG, embedding models and vector databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we seek to go beyond RAG to generate the model answer by applying other relevant steps in the answer pipeline.\n",

The best way to learn her recipe and techniques is to have her walk you through making the pie step-by-step. Ask her to share any tips or tricks she's picked up over the years.\\n\\n2. Get the recipe from her. See if she's willing to write down the full recipe with measurements and instructions. This will give you the basic framework to start with.\\n\\n3. Observe her making the pie. Watch closely as she prepares the crust, fillings, and assembles the pie. Note any little details she does that may not be written in the recipe.\\n\\n4. Take notes. When she's making the pie, jot down any extra tips she shares, like how to tell when the crust is perfectly baked or how to ensure the filling thickens properly.\\n\\n5. Ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask her why she does certain steps a certain way. Understanding the reasoning behind her methods can help you replicate the recipe accurately.\\n\\n6. Experiment. Once you have the basic recipe, try making the pie yourself. Adjust small things and see how it affects the final result. This can help you learn her technique.\\n\\nThe key is to learn from your mom directly if possible. Her personal touches and tricks are what make the recipe uniquely hers. With her guidance, you can master making the pies just the way she does.\""

On the one hand, they do not cover the breadth of necessary examples, and on the other, given that any submitted query is rarely relevant to all supplied examples, they often introduce unecessary tokens and noise to the prompt. In constrast, supplying dynamic few-shots from a larger corpus of examples enables us to select a number of the most relevant examples prior to inference. Evidently, these are determined by the nature of the query. Although we apply it to intent classification, dynamic few-shots can be applied anywhere in the RAG pipeline and generally yield stronger results compared to static examples. \n",
